#current status

Currently, there is only one functioning feature. This functionality removes any non-basic component requirements for blocks. Essentially, this entails removing any requirement for components that cannot be created from a survival kit, replacing them with components that can be created from a survival kit. The only exception is that any component requirements for power cells will not be changed.

#Using this script

Currently, this script only works on files in the "CubeBlocks" folder. The text file "available_list" must contain the file names of any SBC files you want to edit. Do not include the file extension. Each file name must be on a separate line. Avoid placing any blank lines in this file.

CubeBlocks_ArmorPanels
CubeBlocks_Automation
CubeBlocks_Communications
CubeBlocks_Control
CubeBlocks_DecorativePack
